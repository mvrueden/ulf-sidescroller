# ulf-sidescroller
The Ulf sidescroller was initially started at OpenNMS DEV JAM 2015.  The overall idea is to create a sidescroller with Ulf as the hero.

This "game" is based on Unity's 2D example project "2D potato" and is sligthly modified.

As of now it is a learning prototype and will hopefully developed further in the future.
